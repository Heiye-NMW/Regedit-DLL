# Regedit-DLL
A DLL written in C language is used for operating the registry, specifically designed for calls from the e language (and C language) (as I find the registry operations in the e language not very user-friendly, although my implementation is not ideal either). For details, please refer to regedit.heiye.xin or check the readme.md file.
